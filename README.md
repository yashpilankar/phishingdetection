# Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning
Cyber-attacks were able to draw millions of dollar via various attacks on social media where phishing being one of them. Phishing is one of the modest crime where
the attacker tricks a user on internet and are able to fetch the private details of user like login id password, bank details or credit card details. Hence it is important to develop a technology which help to tackle situation like phishing where the system can be able to detect unauthentic website URL and block them. 
This projects aims to solve the following problem statement: _Is the given website safe for browsing or not, by using URL features?_

The dataset is published by Abdelhakim Hannousse and Salima Yahiouche on Mendeley data repository where the dataset has 11,430 URLs with 87 different features.
The dataset was ingress, explored, analyzed, preprocessed & after transforming the data was prepared and various supervised machine learning model were
applied to the data following the KDD methodology. Machine Learning Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier and K-Neighbors Classifier were applied The models were further evaluated based on Precision â€“ Recall score, ROC-AUC score & F1 score for classification.
